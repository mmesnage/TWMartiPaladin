# TWMartiPaladin

How it works : 
1) Create a macro : /script one_of_the_available_functions() (example : /script Pal_MissingTankBlessing())
2) GG

Available functions :

- Pal_MissingTankBlessing :
Only in raid, if you are the paladin assigned to Salvation, and only 2/3 Paladins are in, tanks may miss Might or Light.
Spam it before a fight to give tanks those buffs.
