# TWMartiPaladin

How it works : 
1) Create a macro : /script one_of_the_available_functions() (example : /script TWMMissingTankBlessing())
2) GG

Available functions :

- **TWMMissingTankBlessing** :
Only in raid, if you are the paladin assigned to Salvation, and too few Paladins are in, tanks may miss Kings, Might or Light (because they remove your Salvation buff).
Spam it before a fight to give tanks missing 5min blessings.
